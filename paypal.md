Generic Coding Session 

What can candidates expect? 

This interview focuses heavily on coding. Candidates will be assessed on how they solved the problem as well as the structure and style of your code. It’s best to avoid bugs, but the interviewer will not compile your code so there is no need to worry about making minor mistakes. Finding and catching bugs in codes is a positive sign! Additionally, interviewers will want to hear the candidate’s thought process throughout, so candidates are expected provide a narrative as they go through the code.  

What do we look for? 

Interviewer should be thinking about how a candidate's skills and experience might benefit PayPal. In the coding interview, the interviewer should assess the candidate’s performance on four focus areas: 

Problem Solving: We’re evaluating how the candidate comprehends and explains complex ideas. Is the candidate providing the reasoning behind a particular solution? Developing and comparing multiple solutions? Using appropriate data structures? Speaking about space and time complexity? Optimizing your solution? 
Coding: Can the candidate convert solutions to executable code? Is the code organized and does it have the right logical structure? 
Verification: Is the candidate considering a reasonable number of test cases or coming up with a good argument for why your code is correct? If the candidate's solution has bugs, is the candidate able to walk through his/her own logic to find them and explain what the code is doing? 
Communication: Is the candidate asking for requirements and clarity when necessary, or is the candidate just diving into the code? The coding interview should be a conversation, so the candidate should not forget to ask questions. 
 

Machine Learning Coding Session  

What can candidates expect? 

The candidate will be asked about their understanding of an ML framework (like TensorFlow, PyTorch) and a core ML concept relevant to the team's sub-field (such as transformers, convolutional nets, etc.). They will need to correctly implement a solution and explain its function within a broader system. A follow-up question may involve system extension to a more complex scenario. 

What do we look for? 

The machine learning coding session has a focus on machine learning programming experiences and ability. The questions should be those related to machine learning. Examples could be **constructing a list of bigrams from a list of sentences, coding K-means clustering** etc. It is OK if the candidate could not complete the task during the interview. We focus on understanding the following of the candidate: 

- **Exposure to Big Data and Feature Engineering**: How proficient or familiar is the candidate on DataFrame handling? On Spark? On SQL? 
- **Exposure to ML programming**: Can the candidate write a Python class to implement linear regression? Can the candidate write codes on PyTorch/Tensorflow? On Scikit-learn? 
- **Understanding of ML and statistical algorithms**: For example, can the candidate code out a **multinomial random number generator**? Is the candidate comfortable with statistics? Can the candidate write codes for reservoir sampling? What about self-attention? 
* This module could include some Pandas/Numpy/SQL questions.

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("FraudDetection").getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.parquet("s3://transaction-data")
df.groupBy("user_id").agg({"amount": "stddev"}).show()
```
1. Process 10GB dataset using Spark RDD/DataFrame API
2. Optimize Pandas operations for memory efficiency
3. Write SQL window functions for temporal feature engineering
4. Implement feature scaling pipeline

1. Implement OLS regression with NumPy only
2. Code K-means with convergence criteria
3. Write a gradient descent optimizer class
4. Create PyTorch DataLoader for custom dataset
5. Validate model using k-fold cross-validation

### Day 4: Statistical Algorithms & Sampling
**Key Concepts**:
- Reservoir sampling
- Multivariate distributions
- Statistical testing

**Practice Tasks**:
```python
# Reservoir sampling implementation
def reservoir_sample(stream, k):
    reservoir = []
    for i, item in enumerate(stream):
        if i < k:
            reservoir.append(item)
        else:
            j = random.randint(0, i)
            if j < k:
                reservoir[j] = item
    return reservoir
```
1. Implement multinomial distribution generator
2. Calculate AUC without sklearn
3. Handle class imbalance in fraud detection
4. Optimize stratified sampling for large datasets
5. Explain Central Limit Theorem applications

### Day 5: Advanced ML Concepts
**Focus Areas**:

- Production considerations

**Practice Tasks**:
1. Implement multi-head self-attention
2. Prune neural network weights
3. Quantize model for mobile deployment
4. Explain teacher-student distillation
5. Design A/B test for model rollout

### Day 6: Mock Interviews & System Design
**Practice Scenarios**:
1. Fraud detection system architecture
2. Real-time transaction scoring
3. Model monitoring pipeline
4. Feature store implementation
5. Handling concept drift

**Final Preparation**:
- Review PayPal's ML blog posts and patents
- Practice explaining technical choices
- Prepare STAR-formatted project stories
- Study PayPal's fraud detection papers
- Mock interview with timing constraints

This plan balances framework proficiency (Days 1-2), algorithmic understanding (Days 3-4), and production-level considerations (Days 5-6). Each day includes both coding exercises and conceptual review, reflecting the interview's dual focus on implementation and system thinking[1][3].
